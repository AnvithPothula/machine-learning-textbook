# Concept Taxonomy

This document defines the categorical taxonomy for organizing the 200 machine learning concepts.

## Taxonomy Categories

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts
Core machine learning concepts that form the basis for all other learning. Includes fundamental terminology, data concepts, and basic ML paradigms.

### KNN - K-Nearest Neighbors
Concepts related to the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm including distance metrics, lazy learning, and KNN applications.

### TREE - Decision Trees
Concepts related to decision tree algorithms including splitting criteria, tree structure, entropy, information gain, and pruning.

### LOGREG - Logistic Regression
Concepts related to logistic regression including sigmoid functions, binary and multiclass classification, maximum likelihood, and softmax.

### SVM - Support Vector Machines
Concepts related to support vector machines including margins, hyperplanes, kernel methods, and dual formulation.

### CLUST - Clustering
Concepts related to unsupervised learning clustering algorithms, primarily k-means clustering and related metrics.

### NN - Neural Networks
Concepts related to basic neural networks including neurons, activation functions, forward/backward propagation, and gradient descent.

### CNN - Convolutional Networks
Concepts specific to convolutional neural networks including convolution operations, pooling, feature maps, and CNN architectures.

### TL - Transfer Learning
Concepts related to transfer learning, pre-trained models, fine-tuning, and domain adaptation.

### EVAL - Evaluation Metrics
Concepts related to model evaluation, validation, cross-validation, confusion matrices, and performance metrics.

### PREP - Data Preprocessing
Concepts related to data preparation including normalization, standardization, encoding, and feature engineering.

### OPT - Optimization
Concepts related to optimization algorithms, regularization techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection.

### REG - Regularization
Concepts specific to regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, including L1, L2, dropout, and early stopping.

### MISC - Miscellaneous
Other important concepts that don't fit cleanly into the above categories.
