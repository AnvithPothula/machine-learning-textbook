## Description

Visualize how training and validation errors evolve during model training.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the relationship between training and validation error
- Recognize signs of overfitting and underfitting
- Identify optimal early stopping points

## Key Scenarios

- **Good Fit**: Both errors decrease and converge
- **Overfitting**: Training error decreases, validation error increases
- **Underfitting**: Both errors remain high
- **Early Stopping**: Optimal point before overfitting begins
