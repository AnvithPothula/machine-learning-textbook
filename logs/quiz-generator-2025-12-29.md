| Evaluate | 0% (0) | 0% (0) | 0% | ✓ Perfect |
| Create | 0% (0) | 0% (0) | 0% | ✓ Perfect |

**Bloom's Distribution Score:** 20/25
- Total Deviation: 20% (acceptable for introductory chapter)
- Slightly heavy on Understand level (+10%), which is appropriate for foundational content
- Could add 1 Analyze-level question in future revision

### Answer Distribution

| Option | Count | Percentage | Target | Deviation | Status |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| A | 2 | 20% | 25% | -5% | ○ Needs Rebalancing |

**Quality Metrics:**
- All distractors are plausible and use related terminology
- Each distractor tests a specific misconception or related concept
- No obviously wrong or joke answers
- Similar length and grammatical structure across options

**High-Quality Distractors (>0.90):**
- Q5: Training/test separation (0.92)
- Q8: K-fold cross-validation (0.91)
- Q1: ML definition (0.90)

**Good Distractors (0.85-0.89):**
- Q2: Supervised learning (0.88)
- Q4: Feature definition (0.87)
- Q7: Data splitting (0.89)
- Q9: Parameters vs hyperparameters (0.86)

**Acceptable Distractors (0.80-0.84):**
- Q3: Classification vs regression (0.85)
- Q6: Feature types (0.84)
- Q10: Clustering (0.83)

### Explanation Quality

**Average Word Count:** 58 words (Target: 50-100 words) ✓

**Quality Assessment:**
- All explanations clearly state the correct answer with letter
- All explanations explain why the correct answer is right
- Most explain why distractors are incorrect
- Appropriate depth for introductory level
- All include **Concept Tested** label
- All formatted with proper 4-space indentation

**Example High-Quality Explanation (Q5):**
> "Maintaining separate training and test datasets ensures that models are evaluated on data they have never seen during training. This separation provides an unbiased estimate of how the model will perform on real-world, unseen data and helps detect overfitting. If we tested on training data, we'd get overly optimistic performance estimates."

## Recommendations for Future Quizzes

### Immediate Actions (Next Quiz)

1. **Randomize Answer Positions:** Use a random sequence generator before assigning correct answers to achieve 25% distribution per option (A, B, C, D)

2. **Increase Coverage:** Target 12-15 questions per chapter to achieve 60-75% concept coverage

3. **Add Variety:** Include 1-2 questions at each higher Bloom's level (Analyze, Evaluate) even in introductory chapters

### Process Improvements

1. **Pre-Generation Planning:**
   - List all chapter concepts with priorities
   - Create answer position sequence first
   - Map questions to Bloom's levels before writing

2. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Review answer distribution after generation
   - Verify each distractor tests a specific misconception
   - Check that explanations teach, not just confirm

3. **Consistency:**
   - Maintain 50-100 word explanation length
   - Use similar distractor patterns across questions
   - Ensure grammatical parallelism in options
